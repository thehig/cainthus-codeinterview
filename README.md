# Cainthus Frontend Challenge

## Getting ready

Install Create React App:

`$ npm install -g create-react- app`
`$ create-react- app cainthus-frontend`
`$ cd cainthus-frontend/`
`$ npm start`

## Description

Your task is to create a React application that lets the user input a tag and shows the 20 latest photos posted on Flickr that match it.

Each search result should include: a thumbnail, a link to the photo on flickr.com, the title, the tags, the owner and the date it was taken.

The user should be able to load the rest of the photos in chunks of 20 by scrolling to the end of the page (infinite scrolling).

## Resources

See the documentation for the flickr api here: `https://www.flickr.com/services/api/`.

Use the following api_key: `3b05b1c548a89c1fbcfffab7e3f9a5d3`.

You can import any third party library you need with npm install. Remember to save any dependency to package.json.

## Additional requirements

Target modern browsers (you can use the latest standards without worrying about retrocompatibility).

Target screens with a mininimum screen resolution of 1440x900.

## Review criteria

* User interface is built with React Components
* Application/Components state is minimal and follows React best practices
* User interface follows basic usability guidelines: feedback of system status, help/documentation if needed, error prevention/recovery
* Code quality (DRY, KISS, good variable names, consistent indentation...)
* Visual design is consistent and organized through grouping and hierarchy (will not evaluate artistic skills)

## Delivery

Once done, zip the cainthus-frontend folder and reply to this email attaching the archive. Please do not include the node_modules folder in your submission!
